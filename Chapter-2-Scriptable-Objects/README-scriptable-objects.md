# Chapter 2: ScriptableObjects
The goal of this chapter is to provide users with use cases for ScriptableObjects. It also aims to familiarize users with their creation and management. At the end of this chapter, users will have built a demo using a ScriptableObject. 

## Why ScriptableObjects?
A ScriptableObject is a data container that exists independently from game objects. This means that you can edit its properties without it being tied to a game object in your working scene. You can think of a ScriptableObject as a template. You can use this template to create individual instances that have their own specific objects. For example, consider a Vehicle ScriptableObject. You can make different instances of it that represent specific types of vehicles: Truck, Car, Boat, Plane, etc.
